# IoT-Smart-Energy-Management
## Monitoring of consumed electricity over Internet.
## Ranked 3𝑟𝑑 among 107 students in the project competition.

### Components used:
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** as the main controller,
- Universal **Energy Meter** to measure electricity data,
- **Optocoupler* to isolate low voltage NodeMCU circuit from comparatively high voltage energy meter,
and so on.
